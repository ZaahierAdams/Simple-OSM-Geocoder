## About
This is a Python application for geocoding addresses. 
It converts addresses to geographical coordinates using the open-source API *Nominatim*. 

### This repository includes:
- ``` Simple OSM Geocoder.exe``` the application as an executable  
- ``` main.py``` the applicationâ€™s raw code  
- ```input.csv``` test input data for the application 

## How to use 
1. Input data:
	- Should be in the same directory as the application
	- the file should be ```.csv``` format and named ```input.csv```
 	- Within ```input.csv``` list the addresses to be geocoded
  
  
2. To Run the application, either:
    - Double click on the ``` Simple OSM Geocoder.exe``` 
    - **(or)** run the ``` main.py```. You will need to install [Python]( https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Geocoder]( https://pypi.org/project/geocoder/) library.


3. Once completed, the application will produce two .csv files: 
    - ```Geocoded Addresses.csv``` Contains addresses that were geocoded
    - ```Failed.csv``` Contains addresses that **failed** to geocode
